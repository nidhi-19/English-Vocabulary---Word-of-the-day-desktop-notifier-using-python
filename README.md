# English-Vocabulary---Word-of-the-day-desktop-notifier-using-python

Improving English Vocabulary is a very important since a robust vocabulary improves all areas of communication â€” listening, speaking, reading and writing.
Learning a new word can create a whole cascade of thinking that leads to better mastery of a language.
Students begin thinking of how they use the word. They look at their own vocabulary to create a sentence where the word will fit. 
They think about the time and place to use such a word.
But students are negligent towards the habit of learning a new word everyday and adopt it in usage in the communication.
Therefore this mini project in python helps in improving of english vocabulary by sending a desktop notification of a new word along with its meaning everyday.
The project is scheduled to run everyday when the user logs on the desktop.
The code is written in python with the help of simple libraries like pandas, plyer, os etc. and is scheduled using windows task manager.![Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98505914/182180698-b1307421-4a11-45e0-992e-d7ff1dcaa278.png)
